# MGNet
The MGNet Collection:   Bibliography on multigrid, multilevel, and domain decomposition methods, and repository of MG codes.  Created and maintained for long time by  Craig C. Douglas (University of Wyoming) and Marietta B. Douglas.  
This is only part of the collection with some of the codes available to me.
