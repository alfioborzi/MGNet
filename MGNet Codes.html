someday (all rights reserved).
When in doubt, contact the author(s) of the package(s) you are interested
in.</p>

<p>Please remember that this is freely distributed software.
Hence, the amount of support you receive will probably be extremely limited,
if any is provided at all.
Some of the authors will provide ample support on consulting or contractual
basis, however.</p>

<p>If you have a multigrid, domain decomposition, or parallel code or package
that you would like to contribute, please send e-mail to me.</p>

have some familiarity with linear multigrid, and would want a slightly more
general approach, or a student who can solve a linear boundary equation, but
is now looking to include time.

We envision a system in which common types of physical problems have
